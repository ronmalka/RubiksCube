# RubiksCube

This assignment has been made as a part of the Computer Graphics course that I took in my bachelor's degree in computer science at Ben-Gurion University.

In this assignment, we have implemented a dynamic Rubik's cube.

We dealt with calculating and rotate of a matrix, picking shaders,  different sizes of cubes.
